# Churn Prediction using ANN

This project implements an end-to-end churn prediction system using a
feedforward Artificial Neural Network.

## Features
- Proper preprocessing & scaling
- ANN with dropout regularization
- Early stopping & learning-rate scheduling
- ROC-AUC based evaluation
- Model + scaler persistence

## Run Training
```bash
python run.py train
